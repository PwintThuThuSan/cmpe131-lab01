Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it prevent?
Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a team, as it allows for independent work. In branches, fixes were made separately until they were merged.  Thus, the branches can prevent overwriting teammates' changes and also reduce merge conflicts.
